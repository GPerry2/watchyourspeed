    //example using the latest on the develop branch (considered non-production ready) of the core:
    //"core": "https://github.com/CityofToronto/corejs.git#develop"
    //use this to have access to the latest and greatest changes

    //example using a feature branch:
    //"core": "https://github.com/CityofToronto/corejs.git#feature/my_feature"
    //use this to test out a feature branch

    //example using the latest on the master branch (considered production ready) of the core:
    //"core": "https://github.com/CityofToronto/corejs.git#master"
    //use this to use the latest release-ready version of the core

    //example using a specific version of the core:
    //"core": "https://github.com/CityofToronto/corejs.git#1.3.0"
    //always use a specific release version before deploying to production
